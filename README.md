<h1><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Assignment 2</strong></h1>

In this assignment, you will practice writing a plan to define a project’s requirements (consult Assignment 3 for more info about the project). You will need materials from lesson 3 to complete this assignment. Please check the instructions and requirements.

In assignment 3, you will create your first ‘mobile-fit’ web application. The project is about creating a simple to-do list. For now, in Assignment 2, you will need to write a plan, and you will start by identifying project requirements, designing an application interface, and sketching a prototype.

Instructions

<ol>

 <li>Your plan should be organized in three sections:

  <ol>

   <li>The first section (Description section) contains your description and conveys your understanding of the project. This section should answer the questions: <strong><em>“What do you want to make?” </em></strong>and<strong><em> “What technology will you use?” </em></strong>Please consult slides from Lesson 4 for guidance.

    <ol>

     <li><strong><em>“What do you want to make?”</em></strong>

      <ol>

       <li>Specify the steps required to accomplish the project objectives.</li>

       <li>List the tasks that must be completed at each step (using Work Breakdown Structures).</li>

       <li>Estimate how much effort each task will require.</li>

       <li>Itemize the resources required for each task.</li>

      </ol></li>

     <li><strong><em>“What technology will you use?”</em></strong>

      <ol>

       <li>Determine which languages you will use (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript).</li>

       <li>Identify the most effective libraries (e.g. jQuery, Bootstrap).</li>

       <li>Select your environments (e.g. cross browsers).</li>

      </ol></li>

     <li>The second section (Features section) contains all the information about the project (application) features. You <strong>must</strong> draw a chart for each feature and identify the process flow between features. You need to address only those features listed in Assignment 3, beneath the heading ‘<strong><em>instructions’</em></strong>. This second section should answer the question:</li>

    </ol></li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>

<strong><em>“What features will the application include?”</em></strong>

<ol>

 <li>The third section (Prototype section) contains all the information about the project prototype. You must provide a design and height level chart. The prototype should show the feature and process flow, and specify how these processes relate to each other.</li>

</ol>

<ol start="2">

 <li>Things to keep in mind:

  <ol>

   <li>The project features (code) should be divided into units of (tasks/steps) functionality: modules, services, and so on. Avoid the temptation to have all your code in one huge <em>$(document).ready() </em> This concept, loosely, is known as encapsulation.</li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>

<strong>       </strong>

<ol>

 <li>Despite jQuery’s DOM-centric nature, JavaScript applications are not all about the DOM. Remember that not all pieces of functionality need to—or should—have a DOM representation.</li>

 <li>Units of functionality should be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling">loosely coupled:</a> That is, a unit of functionality should be able to exist on its own, and communication between units should be handled via a messaging system such as custom events or pub/sub. Stay away from direct communication between units of functionality whenever possible.</li>

 <li>Requirements</li>

</ol>

<ol>

 <li>The project plan must include all three sections: the project description, features chart, and project prototype.</li>

 <li>The document should be formatted as follows:

  <ol>

   <li>The font size must be 12 points.</li>

   <li>The font type must be Arial.</li>

   <li>Headlines should appear in bold, and paragraphs in <u>a </u>regular, unbolded font.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>The project plan should not exceed three pages.</li>

 <li>Do not repeat yourself. Identify similarities among pieces of functionality and use inheritance techniques to avoid repetitive features.</li>

</ol>
